# Information for this case

sea salt and carbonaceous aerosol (no dust) emissions: Southern Hemisphere

- Add an additional mode with the following parameters:
  - Dpg ranges between 0.015 - 0.053 micrometer
  - sigma_g = 1.6 (constant)
  - Emission flux between 0 and 2*10^8 1/(m^2 * s)
  - composition is 100% SO4

- Add another additional mode with the same ranges/parameters
  - but composition is 100% sea salt
- More detail: we want the sea salt and the sulfate externally mixed. In MAM4 they are internally mixed, but thatâ€™s not what they should be.
